FASTDD
======
fastdd  is  an open-ended  imagin tool.  It  provides  a powerful  command  line
interface  to perform efficent imaging of devices,  or more in general of files.
It also provides a C++ interface  that allows developers to easily extend fastdd
capabilities, modifying copied data on-the-fly.
For more information on this, please visit fastdd homepage:

or its page on git:

REQUIREMENTS

zlib1g
libboost-regex
libssl

USAGE
=====
SYNOPSIS
--------
fastdd [OPERANDS] [OPTIONS]

OPERANDS
--------
if=FILE
	specify input file, default stdin
of=FILE
	specify output file, default stdout. Can be used more than once.
bs=BYTES
	read and write BYTES bytes at time
ibs=BYTES
	read BYTES bytes at time (must be multiple or submultiple of obs)
obs=BYTES
	write BYTES bytes at time (must be multiple or submultiple of ibs)
count=BLOCKS
	number of input block ibs-sized to read
skip=BLOCKS
	number of input block ibs-sized to skip
seek=BLOCKS
	number of output block obs-sized to seek (padded with '\0' in new files)
log=FILE
	enable verbose mode and save output produced in FILE
reread-bs=BYTES
	when a input reading error occurs, re-read the current input block with
	this block size (to mantain an high reading speed). When one of these
	blocks have an error will be read at 512-bytes blocks. Default: 512.
reading-attempts=N
	try to read N times a 512-bytes sector before considering it unreadeble
	(default: 1). Use reading-attempts=0 to avoid any further reading of
	damaged blocks (just pad it with \0)
hash-blocks=ALGORITHM1[,ALGORITHM2,...]
	use the specified hash algorithms to check input and output blocks
hash-files=ALGORITHM1[,ALGORITHM2,...]
	use the specified hash algorithms to check input and output files
hash-blocks-save=FILE
	save in FILE the hash of the input blocks

OPTIONS
--hash-blocks-check, -c
	re-read every written block and check its hashes with the corrisponding
	input block. Exit on re-reading error
--hash-file-in
	print hashes of input file at the end of computation
--hash-file-out
	print hashes of output file at the end of computation
--hash-file-all, -f
	print hashes of all files at the end of computation
--direct-input-disabled, -i
	disable O_DIRECT flag in opening input file
--direct-output-disabled, -o
	disable O_DIRECT flag in opening output file
--get-partition-table
	print the partition table contained in the input file (if any)
--fast
	same as 'reading-attempts=0 bs=16M'
--no-parallel, -p
	make every read/write action sequentially, without using multi-threading
--no-progress-bar
	disable progress bar
--ignore-modules-errors
	ignore errors occurred in the execution of modules (otherwise it asks how
	to procede, stopping the copy until an answer is given)
--debug
	debug mode, it is ignored if a log file is not specified.
--help, -h
	show this help

BYTES and BLOCKS accept multiplicative suffixes: K=1024, KB=1000,
M=1024*1024, MB=1000*1000, G=1024*1024*1024, GB=1000*1000*1000,
T=1024^4 and TB=1000^4.

MODULES
fastdd's capabilities can be easily expanded by createing a new module
implementing fastdd_module.hpp interface, and adding it to the main program
with few code lines in init_modules() and fin_modules() functions.

EXAMPLES OF USE
fastdd if="input file" of="file with spaces" of=another\ one of=file3
bs=1M hash-files=sha1,sha256 hash-blocks=md5 --hash-blocks-check
--hash-files-all
copy content of file "input file" in files "file with spaces",
"another one" and "file3", showing sha1 and sha256 of all files
and checking the equality of md5 of blocks copied for early stop.
